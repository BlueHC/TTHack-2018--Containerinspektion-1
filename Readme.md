Container Inspection today…
Mostly manual process
Inspection in depots
Expert knowledge needed
Bottleneck process in peak times


Tomorrow / Vision
Detect most important damages automatically based on visual recognition
Early in the process – even at multiple points
Provide assistance for inspectors
Scalability in peak times
Cooperation along the process -> improvement for all

The provided App can be used to take pictures of a container and send them to the ChiefInspector-Server Application.
The Server-Application saves and uses dedicated Visual Recognition Service with a trained Custom Python Model to detect
damages and display indication per Container for the Coordinating Operator if a Container can be reused right away
or needs further inspection and repare.
